#![allow(clippy::wrong_self_convention)]

//! Fluent test assertions in Rust
//!
//! Speculoos is a testing framework designed to make your assertions read like plain English.
//! This allows you to more easily expose the intent of your test, rather than having it shrouded by
//! assertions which work, but are opaque on their meaning.
//!
//! Methods available to assert with are dependent upon the type of the subject under test.
//! Assertions are available for some basic types, but there is still a great deal missing from the
//! standard library.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! speculoos = "0.6.0"
//! ```
//!
//! Then add this to your crate:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate speculoos;
//! ```
//!
//! If you want macro support, include `#[macro_use]` to the declaration:
//!
//! ```rust, ignore
//! #[macro_use]
//! extern crate speculoos;
//! ```
//!
//! To quickly start using assertions, `use` the prelude module:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use speculoos::prelude::*;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! We're going to make a few assertions on a `String` we create. Normally you would
//! want to assert on the output of something, but we'll just pretend that something created it.
//!
//! First, we'll create a new test with our `String`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_be_the_correct_string() {
//!     let subject = "Hello World!";
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that it is good practice to make sure that you name your test in a way that actually
//! explains what it is trying to test. When you have a number of tests, and one of them fails,
//! something like this is easier to understand:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_return_false_if_condition_does_not_hold() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Rather than if you have a test like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_work() {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Unfortunately, our test isn't named very well at the moment, but given the lack of context,
//! it'll have to do for now.
//!
//! Now that we have something to test, we need to actually start asserting on it. The first part
//! to that is to provide it to the `assert_that` function. Note that we need to provide it as a
//! reference.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use speculoos::prelude::*;
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_be_the_correct_string() {
//!     let subject = "Hello World!";
//!     assert_that(&subject);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If we run that with `cargo test`, we'll see the following output:
//!
//! ```bash
//! running 1 test
//! test should_be_the_correct_string ... ok
//! ```
//!
//! Our test compiles and passes, but we still haven't made any assertions. Let's make a simple one
//! to start with. We'll check to see that it starts with the letter 'H'.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use speculoos::prelude::*;
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_be_the_correct_string() {
//!     let subject = "Hello World!";
//!     assert_that(&subject).starts_with(&"H");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Once you run this, you'll notice that the test still passes. That's because we've just proven
//! something that was already true. Usually you'll want to start with a failing test, and then
//! change your code to make it pass, rather than writing the test after the implementation.
//!
//! But for the purpose of exploration, let's break the actual value. We'll change "Hello World!"
//! to be "ello World!".
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use speculoos::prelude::*;
//! #[test]
//! pub fn should_be_the_correct_string() {
//!     let subject = "ello World!";
//!     assert_that(&subject).starts_with(&"H");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This time, we see that the test fails, and we also get some output from our assertion to tell
//! us what it was, and what it was expected to be:
//!
//! ```bash
//! running 1 test
//! test should_be_the_correct_string ... FAILED
//!
//! failures:
//!
//! ---- should_be_the_correct_string stdout ----
//!     thread 'should_be_the_correct_string' panicked at 'expected string starting with <"H"> but
//!     was <"ello World!">', src/lib.rs:204
//! ```
//!
//! Great! So we've just encountered a failing test. This particular case is quite easy to fix up
//! (just add the letter 'H' back to the start of the `String`), but we can also see that the panic
//! message tells us enough information to work that out as well.
//!
//! Now, this was just a simple example, and there's a number of features not demonstrated, but
//! hopefully it's enough to start you off with writing assertions in your tests using Speculoos.
